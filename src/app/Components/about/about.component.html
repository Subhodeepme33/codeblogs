            The best ideas can change who we are. <strong>CodePencil</strong> is where those ideas take shape, take off,
            and spark powerful conversations. We’re an open platform where 170 million readers come
            to find insightful and dynamic thinking. Here, expert and undiscovered voices alike dive
            into the heart of any topic and bring new ideas to the surface. Our purpose is to spread
            these ideas and deepen understanding of the world.
            We’re creating a new model for digital publishing. One that supports nuance,
            complexity, and vital storytelling without giving in to the incentives of advertising.
            It’s an environment that’s open to everyone but promotes substance and authenticity.
            And it’s where deeper connections forged between readers and writers can lead to
            discovery and growth. Together with millions of collaborators, we’re building a trusted
            and vibrant ecosystem fueled by important ideas and the people who think about them.
